## Additional Resources

In addition to the source code and bootcamp projects, we provide additional resources to assist in learning and skill development:

- Links to relevant articles, tutorials, and documentation
- Recommended bibliography for further exploration of the topics covered
- Code examples

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main sections to facilitate navigation and access to the different resources:

### 1. Exercises

The exercises folder contains all the practical exercises and projects corresponding to each module. Inside this folder, you will find subfolders for each module, allowing you to easily locate and access the exercises for a specific topic.

The structure of the exercises folder is as follows:

```
exercises/
  ├── Module 2 - Agile Methodologies/
  ├── Module 3 - Git/
  ├── Module 4 - Introduction to Java Programming/
  ├── Module 5 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)/
  ├── Module 6 - Spring Boot/
  ├── Module 7 - MySQL Databases/
  ├── Module 8 - Hibernate/
  ├── Module 9 - HTML/CSS/
  ├── Module 10 - Basic JavaScript/
  ├── Module 11 - Security: Authentication, Authorization, Cryptography/
  ├── Module 12 - Software Testing: JUnit and Mockito/
  ├── Module 13 - TDD and Cucumber/
  ├── Module 14 - Application Deployment: Application Servers, Application Containers/
  ├── Module 15 - Desktop Application Development with Java: JavaFX, Swing/
  └── Module 16 - Basic ReactJS/
```

Within each module folder, you will find the exercises and projects associated with that specific topic. Each exercise is further organized with clear instructions, starter code, and any necessary resources.

### 2. APIs

The `apis` folder contains the projects and code related to the development of APIs using the Spring framework. This section focuses on practical implementations of backend APIs, showcasing the use of Spring Boot, database integration, and other relevant concepts.

The structure of the APIs section is as follows:

```
apis/
  ├── Project 1/
  ├── Project 2/
  ├── Project 3/
  └── ...
```

Inside the `api` folder, you will find subfolders for each project. Each project folder contains the source code, configuration files, and any necessary dependencies for the respective API project.

This division allows for easy access and exploration of both the exercise materials and the API projects developed throughout the bootcamp.

Feel free to navigate through the repository and explore the different sections according to your learning needs and interests. Happy coding!
